# COVID19_impact_in_Canada

This study provides an analytical overview of the COVID-19 pandemic's trajectory in
Canada, examining its ramifications across the country. In this study, the focus was on the
two biggest provinces of Canada: Ontario and Quebec. We delve into a time series analysis
and other relevant data to evaluate the pandemic's impact, considering provincial spread and
the ratio of fatalities to total cases. The evolution of the pandemic is scrutinized, particularly
in the context of Canadian policy interventions, to assess their effectiveness on case numbers.
Additionally, the study explores the disparities in case distribution nationwide, offering
insight into the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic's effects.

During this projects the following technologies were used: Alteryx Designer, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau. Then the final report was made.
